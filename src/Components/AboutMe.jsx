        As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL INSTITUTE OF TECH., VASAD, I have honed my technical skills, particularly in JavaScript eXtension (JSX) and Python. My most recent engagement as a ReactJs Intern at Tech Elecon Pvt. Ltd. allowed me to apply these competencies in a dynamic, real-world setting.

        Volunteering at SSIP CELL, SVIT, I contributed to hosting an IoT workshop, which enhanced my presenting and management skills while deepening my understanding of IoT applications. Our team's collaborative efforts led to a successful educational event, and I am eager to bring this experience, alongside my technical expertise, to contribute meaningfully to a forward-thinking organization.
